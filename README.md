# CMEE Groupwork Repository

This repository contains computing groupwork for the [MSc Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/life-sciences/computational-methods-ecology-evolution/) at Imperial College London.

This repository is divided into weeks, with the directory for each week containing a combination of the following subdirectories:
* Data - contains data files used during the week.
* Code - contains all code scripts for the week.
* Results - empty directory for any results files to be pushed into if they exist.

Scripts in the *Code/* directory are typically run on files in the *Data/* directory, with results (if there are any) being pushed into the *Results/* directory.

E.g.

```
$ python3 Week2/Code/align_seqs_better.py Week2/Data/407228326.fasta Week2/Data/407228412.fasta
```
